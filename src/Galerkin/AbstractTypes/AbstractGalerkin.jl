# AbstractGelerkin
This modul is supposed to give a scaffold for numerical solvers based on Galerkin methods like FEM, Spectral methods (like Chebyshev, FFT, Polynomials) or Kernel methods.
Is goes that it implements:
- A hilbertspace that allows for one or multiple forms of scalar product, especially H¹ and L².
- a general adjoint-state-method that drives the iterative upgrade by calculating a gradient
- some sort of adaptive method that refines the parameters of the interpolation space (like adaptive meshing)
- some sort of boundary projection and back projection that manages parametrization of the boundary
- Some sort of Metric or Pseudometric that measures the error.
- Some sort of Regularization.
- Some sort of
